# Welcome to Price-It!

This project was created using React, Bootstrap and scss.
Point of the project is to collect data from shops about product prices and then compare them.

## TODO List:

• Setup a backend server and chanel scraper requests trough the server. Doing this will remove CORS error that occurs now. Move scrapers to backend and not frontend. Completed ✅

• Make result cards for each shop search. In results window there should be a stack of resultCard for each shop. They should be vertical.

• Show loader when searching when the previous search results are displayed.

• Rimi brings back 20 results when barbora returns 5.

• Iki (LastMile) scraper.

• Check maybe it's possible to get price from Lidl and Norfa.

## Future planed updates:

Future plans on expanding this project further and adding more functions:

### Add more items to navbar:

• Statistics about product prices;
• Instructions on how to use the search tool.

### Add an option to insert items to a shopping cart:

• Calculate full price;
• Make different carts:
• Cheapest;
• Cheapest including gas;
• Cheapest in one shop etc.

### Maybe add some premium/paid tier

Like shopping carts only for premium users etc.

### Add possibility to change how many results is returned

Only for premium users add option to change results from 5 to 10 etc.

### Add links to the products

After search is completed add links to search so users can go to e - shops and see the results. Or add that pressing on returned products takes user to that product page in the shop.

### When hovering on name show product picture

Check if this is even possible. Need to check if images are returned.

### Add counter for requests

Non - premium users can only make i.e. 5 requests every 24h.

### Add the the most popular searches:

Add top 5 products searched and display times this product has been searched.

### Add graphs for price history:

Store products price history in server and add graphs/other info on how that price changes.

### Add product cart:

Store products in a cart, show their prices and where to buy them.

### Add trip planner that plans trips to the store:

Google maps API that helps plan shortest trip to the store where the cheapest products are, add trip cost to the total shopping cost. Make some options- shortest trip, cheapest trip etc.
